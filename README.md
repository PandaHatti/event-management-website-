# event-management-website-
Created a basic Event Management website for a comapny called 5 CHeers
hello..
this is a very basic event management website that I created in my first year of MCA as a mini project. 

In this: I have used visual studio as my software and html/css and vanilla as my front end designing 
backend: Firsebase for login and registration 

This project will be kept on being updated.
